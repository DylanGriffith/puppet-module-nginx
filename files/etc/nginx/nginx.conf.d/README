The contents of this directory, and all subdirectories therein, are managed
automatically by Puppet.  That means that if you add, modify, or remove
files in this tree by hand, your changes will be reverted next time Puppet
runs.

If you really, *really* need to make changes to this configuration tree by
hand, you will need to either disable Puppet from running for the duration
of your change's effective lifetime, or else somehow make the changes you
have made immutable.
